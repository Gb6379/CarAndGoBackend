# Production 500 Error - Fixed

## Problem
The backend was returning 500 errors in production (Railway) but working fine locally.

## Root Cause
The migration runner in `main.ts` wasn't handling Railway's `DATABASE_URL` format. It only checked for individual environment variables (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, etc.), but Railway provides a connection string like:
```
postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

This caused migrations to fail, which crashed the entire application.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Migration Runner (`main.ts`)
- Added support for parsing `DATABASE_URL` 
- Falls back to individual env vars for local development
- Added SSL configuration for production
- Enhanced error logging

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added try-catch wrapper in bootstrap
- Better error messages for debugging
- Application exits gracefully on startup failure

## What Changed

**Before:**
```typescript
const dataSource = new DataSource({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',  // ❌ Doesn't work with Railway
  // ...
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (databaseUrl) {
  const url = new URL(databaseUrl);  // ✅ Parses Railway's DATABASE_URL
  dbConfig = {
    host: url.hostname,
    port: parseInt(url.port, 10),
    username: url.username,
    password: url.password,
    database: url.pathname.substring(1),
    ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }  // ✅ SSL for production
  };
}
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix production database connection for Railway"
   git push
   ```

2. **Railway will automatically:**
   - Detect the push
   - Build the application
   - Run migrations on startup
   - Start the server

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Check Railway logs for "✅ Migrations completed successfully"
   - Test your API endpoints

## Environment Variables (Railway)

Make sure these are set in Railway:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Auto-provided by Railway PostgreSQL
- `JWT_SECRET` - Your JWT secret key
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` - e.g., "7d"
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"

## Testing

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `GET /users` - Should return user list or empty array
- `POST /auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /auth/login` - Login with credentials

## Monitoring

Check Railway logs for:
- ✅ "Migrations completed successfully"
- ✅ "CAR AND GO Backend API"
- ✅ "Running on port: XXXX"

If you see errors:
- Check the full error message in logs
- Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- Ensure PostgreSQL service is running in Railway
